        <br />I freelance when I can, mostly build custom websites that you
        canâ€™t get from a template. My place in the world seems to be at the{" "}
        <span>intersection of creativity and logic</span>. I approach each
        problem as a <span>learning experience</span> that informs the rest of
        the project.
        <br /> <br />
        Who is visiting your site? What are they looking for? How do they find
        it? These are the pointer that I keep in mind while developing my
        Desktop-first responsive websites with <span>HTML, CSS and React</span>.

          I am always experimenting, always learning, and never bored.
